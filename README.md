## 使用说明

Master分支不包含redux管理状态

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## 学习总结

教程已经比较久远了。遇到问题也不少

### Antdv3升级成v4

根据教程写的，form这块做的一头雾水。只能到官网查API写了，用自己的想法实现了对应的功能。写出来还是怪怪的。暂时就这样吧。主题色没改，整体还是蓝色。偷懒了。

### 主组件的文件名都是index.jsx

跟教程的按组件命名还是有些差别

### 添加了postman的接口json

翻了翻评论区,都没人提供.就自己手打搞了一个

### 服务器地址用的评论区的

地址为：http://120.55.193.14:5000
天气接口换成了高德api，教程百度的挂了

### 其他总结
